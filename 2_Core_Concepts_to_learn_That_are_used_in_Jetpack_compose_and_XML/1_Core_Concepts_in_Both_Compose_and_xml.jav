When developing Android apps with Kotlin without using Jetpack Compose, many core concepts remain the same. Android development concepts such as activities, fragments, intents, layouts, and data persistence apply to both approaches. However, there are differences in how you implement the user interface (UI) and manage the UI-related code.

Here's a breakdown of concepts that are common to both approaches and concepts that are specific to each:

**Common Concepts:**

1. **Kotlin Language:** Regardless of whether you use Jetpack Compose or XML layouts, Kotlin is the recommended language for Android development.

2. **Activities and Fragments:** Activities serve as the entry points for your app's UI, and fragments are used to build modular UI components within activities. This remains true in both approaches.

3. **Layouts:** You can define UI layouts using XML (traditional approach) or use Jetpack Compose's composable functions to build UI elements. The concept of defining layouts remains the same.

4. **Resource Management:** Concepts like resource files (e.g., strings.xml, dimens.xml, colors.xml) for managing resources and assets are common to both approaches.

5. **Data Binding:** Data binding can be used with XML layouts, but you can also use it with Jetpack Compose to bind data to UI elements.

6. **Data Persistence:** Whether you use Jetpack Room (common in both) or other data persistence libraries like SharedPreferences, the concept of data storage and retrieval remains similar.

7. **Network Operations:** Making network requests using libraries like Retrofit, OkHttp, or Volley is common to both approaches.

8. **Dependency Injection:** Concepts of dependency injection with libraries like Dagger Hilt or Koin are applicable to both.

9. **Testing:** Testing methodologies for unit testing and UI testing apply to both approaches.

10. **Security:** Secure coding practices, user authentication, and authorization principles are consistent.

**Specific Concepts:**

1. **Jetpack Compose:** Jetpack Compose introduces a declarative UI approach, where you describe the UI based on its current state, and Compose handles UI updates. This concept is unique to Jetpack Compose.

2. **XML Layouts:** When using XML layouts, you work with XML files to define the UI hierarchy and use Java or Kotlin code to interact with UI elements. Jetpack Compose replaces XML layouts with composable functions.

3. **View Binding:** View binding is commonly used with XML layouts to eliminate the need for `findViewById`. In Jetpack Compose, the need for view binding is reduced as you work directly with composable functions.

4. **Navigation Component:** The Navigation component is used for navigation in both approaches, but the way you define and navigate between destinations differs slightly between XML-based navigation and Jetpack Compose navigation.

5. **Material Design:** Material Design principles and components are used in both approaches, but they are implemented differently in Jetpack Compose, where you use Compose's Material Design components.

In summary, while many core Android development concepts are common to both Kotlin with XML layouts and Kotlin with Jetpack Compose, the key difference lies in how you define and interact with the user interface. Jetpack Compose introduces a declarative and more modern approach to UI development, while the traditional XML layout approach uses imperative XML files and programmatic UI updates. Depending on your project and preferences, you can choose the approach that best fits your requirements.
